### LAB 2 Getting Started with R & Python
R has emerged as among the most popular development environments for analytics.  It has the advantage of being open source and free, has a great community, and it has a tremendous number of packages.  As R is essentially a coding language specific to statistics, it has functional to do just about anything that you want to do.  

Developing with R has made tremendous progress over a short period of time thanks to the developers at RStudio.  RStudio is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for R that provides developers with an easy way to manage the development process. To use RStudio on the virtual, first make sure it is running (`vagrant up` to start).  
  
Log onto the RStudio Sever (Virtual machine needs to be running) using the following.
[http://localhost:8787](http://localhost:8787) 
*Username:* vagrant
*Password:* vagrant

Once you log in you will be presented with the IDE console that has everything that you need to get started with data science.  
![title]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/3_console.png)

When you launch RStudio Server, you immediately see view above.  The R console provides a number of tools that can make data science quick and easy.

On the left side you can see the R console.  The R console directly interprets R code and provides answers.  Try it out by doing some basic math.  
#### Math in R
~~~
3+3
20/4
20^2
~~~
{: .language-r}

Now assign the results to your first data structure the output of a calculation to a new variable. 

~~~
n<-3+3
~~~
{: .language-r}

Notice that as you entered the variable into the R console, it showed up just to the top right of the screen.  This provides a list of the objects available in memory.  Just type `n` into the console again and get access to the variable and print it out.  

*Tip. Want to resubmit or slightly change a previous entry into the console?  Just press up and then down in order to scroll through previous entries.*  

#### Programs (Scripts) in R.
 While the console may allow you to quickly iterate and test commands, most times you are going to want to develop complex combinations of commands that can enable the transformation and analysis of data.  Anything thing entered into the console is not *persistant*, meaning it is not saved past the initial session.  As a result, we recommend working from a script.  In reality, you can think of a script as a program that you are developing to complete some type of process. Start a new script now by File -> New File -> R Script. 

Copy the earlier commands and add it directly to the script.  You can then add comments to the script and save it for future use with the save button.  
![Scripts]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/3_console.png)

There are three different ways to execute the script.  

* The most common mode of operation is to highlight the code that you would like to execute and then press the *execute* (Run current line or selection).  You can also do this using the shortcut key specific for Mac (command-Enter) or Windows (ctrl-enter).
* After running a selection, you may find that you need to make an edit and rerun the same selection.  The thoughtful individuals at RStudio have made this easy. Through the second execute button (Re-run the previous code region). 
* Finally, to execute the entire file, you can execute the source button (with echo to see it in the console). 

####R Vector
A an R Vector is a single set of values in a particular order of the same type.  Even variables that we have set are really just vectors of length 1. 

We can create a vector using the concatenate function `help(c)` for more. Let's say we want a vector with the ages for 4 students.

~~~
ages<-c(18,19,18,23)
~~~
{: .language-r}

To see  this we can just type the name of object:

~~~
ages
~~~ 
{: .language-r}

To pick a specific value, we can, indicate it. *Note. In some languages vectors will start at 0 while in R it will start with 1.* 

~~~
ages[4]
~~~ 
{: .language-r}

To specify the range of the vector, it can be clearly indicated.

~~~
ages[2:4]
~~~ 
{: .language-r}

**We can have vectors of various types, and it is important to note that you cannot have data of 2 different types and have it treated correctly.**

* **String.** These are the clear character vectors.  (Typically use quotes to add to these vectors.)
* **Numeric.**Numbers in a set.  Note there is not a different type  
* **Boolean.** TRUE or FALSE values in a set. 
* **Factor.** A situation in which there is a select set of options.  Things such as states or zip codes.  These are typically things which are related to dummy variables, a topic we will discuss later. 

~~~
names<-c("Sally", "Jason", "Bob", "Susy") #Text
female<-c(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
teachers<-c("Smith", "Johnson", "Johnson", "Smith")
teachers.f<-factor(teachers)
grades<-c(20, 15, 13, 19) #25 points possible

#Question: what happens when we mix types?
age<-c(20, 15, 13, ten) 

#Question: can you do math on vectors?  Try the following. That happens and why?
percent<-(grades/25*100)
age<-age+1
~~~ 
{: .language-r}

In each of the cases except *factor*, the default data provided by R was correct without direct specification.  In the case of factor, the data needed to be explicitly cast as a factor vector.

####R Matrix
An  R matrix has two dimensions and  has similar properties of a vector. As a result must be of a single type.  

~~~
#You can explicitly specify a matrix.
y<-matrix(1:10, nrow=3, ncol=3)

#Or you can put vectors together into a matrix.
mat <- matrix(cells, nrow=4, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE,
  dimnames=list(students, teachers))
  
  #Matrices can be specified by explicitly indicating the row and column, as follows. 
mat[2,1] #Row=2, Column=1
mat[1,]  #Row=1 and all columns 
mat[,1]  #Column=1, all rows
  
~~~
{: .language-r}

Matrix algebra is extremely useful in advanced statistics in which you are employing the underlying mathematical functions to do things like regression or to calculate properties of a network.  However, in the majority of cases we will employ predefined functions in order to do analyses. 

**Question Think back to our Titanic dataset.  Could we employ a matrix for this data** 

#### R List
A list is a vector containing other R objects.  While we won't use it very frequently, it is a flexible data structure will contain the output of another analyses.  

~~~
x = list(names, female, teachers, grades) 
#This will call out the female vector.
x[2]
#This is a way of setting the first component of the list to false. There needs to be two brackets. 
x[[2]][1] = "FALSE" 
~~~
{: .language-r}

#### R Dataframe
The data frame actually a special type of list, and it is the workhouse of the R analytics environment. The distinguishing factor of a data frame over a matrix is the ability to include different types of data.  This means that you can mix numeric, string, boolean, etc.  While R will default to the correct version in many cases, you also need to check that each field is coded correctly.  

Let's first look at a few different ways we can create data frames

~~~
df1<-data.frame(cbind(names,teachers.f, teachers, ages, grades, percent))

~~~
{: .language-r}

To load a file, we have to first tell R where to look by setting the active working directory.  
~~~
getwd()
setwd("/vagrant/data")
list.files()

titantic=read.csv(file="titantic_train.csv", header=TRUE,sep=",")
View(titantic) #show data browser
names(titantic) #show the names
dim(titantic) #show the dimensions of the data frame
head(titantic, 2) #show the first 2 records
tail(titantic, 4) #show the final 2 records
titantic$yearID #show the years in the data frame
summary(titantic) #summarize all variables
str(titantic) #shows the structure of an R Object
~~~
{: .language-r}

#### Using and defining functions in R
R has a wide array of functions that are predefined and can be used in the console.  Before we look at R functions, let's define are own so we understand how they work.  

Let's say we want a function that is ready to add 2 numbers. First we have to *define the function*. 

~~~
#This defines a function called "addTwo."
addTwo <- function(a, b){
c<-a+b
return(c)
}
~~~ 
{: .language-r}

By selecting this function and running it, we can now have access to the function in memory for the rest of this R session.  If we open the script again we would again have to go through the process of loading the function into memory. 

We can then go through the process of utilizing the function by calling it and then specifying the two associated parameters *a & b*. 

~~~
addTwoNumbers(4, 5)
}
~~~ 
{: .language-r}
*Note that the function specification and use is case sensitive.  The use of descriptive functions with all words except the first capitalized in known as [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CamelCase).*

Organizing processing of data into functions is quite convenient and facilitates what is one of the holy grails of programming: *code reuse*.  By organizing processing of data into functions, you can easily process data for different datasets or subsets of the data without rewriting the steps for each. 

There are lots of [built in functions](http://www.statmethods.net/management/functions.html)  in R that can provide important functionality. Run the following and see:

~~~
x<-abs(-20)
textfield<-toupper("this is a lowercase sentence")

~~~ 
{: .language-r}

To understand each function, we can use the embedded help function `help(abs)` to find out about the *absolute value* function and `help(toupper)` to find out about the *to uppercase* function.

We can also apply functions to vectors to generate other variables and vectors.

~~~
grades.sum<-sum(grades)
grades.sum
names.length<-nchar(names) 
names.length 
~~~ 
{: .language-r}


**Questions. 
In completing this challenge, you should do it in class. 
1. Swap the values of two variables, A and B.  
2. Create a function that returns that average, sum, and standard deviation of a vector.**

That is all for now. Let's start looking at some basic data in Python. 

##Intro to Python
When learning different languages, it is useful to map concepts.  In this case we will be going through the process of learning similar concepts in python that we have just learned in R.  The hope is that you will both be able to be fluent in more than one language and gain a better understanding of the underlying concepts.  

To access iPython, you just need to access another port of your localhost.  Localhost is your machine, and Vagrant has done an excellent job of mapping the ports on your machine (that is the 8001 below) to the appropriate port on the virtual machine.
[http://localhost:8001](http://localhost:8001) 
 
 The virtual machine is configured with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org), a tool that evolved from the iPython notebook.  You see, a lot of people realized that the specific form of embedding HTML and code that makes up iPython notebooks, can also be useful for a number of other languages.  Jupyter enables use with Python, Julia, R, Haskell, or Ruby.  We will just be using Python in our in initial work.  
 
# Getting Started with Python
There are a tremendous wealth of tutorials out there that give you the basics of Python. Data science is quite different from application building through, necessitating not different understanding but different applications.

The iPython environment is transitioning to Jupityer, as the notebook style of model has been found to be an extremely valuable method of doing data science that has relevance for other languages like R. In our current VM, we only have the python engine installed, but this area is moving quickly and things are converging quickly.

In iPython, each cell represents a separate input of code.  For example, to complete each of these separate operations they need to be put in three separate cells. 

#### Math in Python

#Note this is a bit different than R.  While R uses a "^", python uses "**" to indicate an exponent.
20**2 
~~~
{: .language-python}

![title]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2_ipython1.png)

Now assign the results to your first data structure the output of a calculation to a new variable. 

~~~
n=3+3
print n
~~~
{: .language-python}

In the specification above, note that we use the `=` to specify a variable in python while in R we used `<-`.  We also had to explicitly specify the output via `print` while the R console just threw it back at us. 

*Tip. Want to resubmit or slightly change a previous entry into the console?  Just press up and then down in order to scroll through previous entries.*  

#### Programs (Scripts) in Python.
 While the cell may allow you to quickly iterate and test commands, most times you are going to want to develop complex combinations of commands that can enable the transformation and analysis of data, as we did in R.   
 
The Jupyter notebook provides a wide number of options to run the cells in different ways.  
![title]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/2_runscripts.png)

For the most part these different methods are self explanatory.  In my case, I find that the majority of the time I will run just the current cell, run all cells, or run the cells above.  While a notebook provides a useful framework to run a series of commands.  

####Python Vector
As in R, a vector is a very common model of interacting with data.  Unlike R, there are different models for using and modeling vectors.  As vectors are objects, they inherit their properties from the underlying classes that define them. 

To work with vectors we are going to first import the [numpy](http://wiki.scipy.org/Tentative_NumPy_Tutorial#head-c5f4ceae0ab4b1313de41aba9104d0d7648e35cc) package.  While we haven't gone over packages yet, this is a way of implementing new functionality. 


~~~
import numpy as np
ages = np.array( [18,19,18,23] )
print ages
~~~
{: .language-python}

To see  this we can just type the name of object:
~~~
ages
~~~ 
{: .language-python}

To pick a specific value, we can, indicate it. *Note. In Python vectors will start at 0 while in R it will start with 1.* 

~~~
ages[3]
~~~ 
{: .language-python}

To specify the range of the vector, it can be clearly indicated.

~~~
????
~~~ 
{: .language-python}

**We can have vectors of various types, and it is important to note that you cannot have data of 2 different types and have it treated correctly.**

Numpy, like R also has different data types, but they are even more extensive in their [options](http://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/basics.types.html).

Here are some more common ones

* **str** These are the clear character vectors.  (Typically use quotes to add to these vectors.)
* **int_**Integer  
* **bool_** TRUE or FALSE values in a set. 

~~~
names=np.array_str_("Sally", "Jason", "Bob", "Susy") 
female=np.array_bool_(TRUE, FALSE, FALSE, TRUE)
names=np.array_str_("Smith", "Johnson", "Johnson", "Smith")
names=np.array_int_(20, 15, 13, 19)  

#Question: what happens when we mix types?
age<-c(20, 15, 13, ten) 

#Question: can you do math on vectors?  Try the following. That happens and why?
percent<-(grades/25*100)
age<-age+1
~~~ 
{: .language-r}

In each of the cases except *factor*, the default data provided by R was correct without direct specification.  In the case of factor, the data needed to be explicitly cast as a factor vector.

mat <- matrix(cells, nrow=4, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE,
  dimnames=list(students, teachers))
  
  #Matrices can be specified by explicitly indicating the row and column, as follows. 
mat[2,1] #Row=2, Column=1
mat[1,]  #Row=1 and all columns 
mat[,1]  #Column=1, all rows
